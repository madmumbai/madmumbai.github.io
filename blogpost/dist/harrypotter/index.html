    <p>This is the one where we had our first ever FP call with all the volunteers of both shelters!🥳 
We created lots of hype beforehand on the WhatsApp group and it couldn’t stop buzzing! After all, it was the first time Salvation and YMCA interacted but we couldn’t tell it was the first time! Everyone was so comfortable with each other.
MAFIA definitely broke the ice and everyone went crazy and had tons of fun! Whoever missed it definitely had FOMO🙊 But we’ve had a few more game nights after that week as well! To know whether the villagers won or the mafias, reach out to the FP Fam. They’ll have lots to share about that night!😂</p>
