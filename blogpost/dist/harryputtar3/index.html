    <p>This year, our SOF, Mehal Shah came up with the Child Mentor Project for the Foundational Programme, before FP MAD classes had begun for this year. FP, as a team, decided topics, fun worksheets and activities to teach our youngest group of children that is our FP kids, in both the shelters. It acted as a revision for them before FP classes started. FP got on weekly calls with the 11th std children and explained these worksheets to them thoroughly. In turn, they would act as mentors and teach the FP children and would make sure they complete the day wise worksheets and activities and support them wherever needed. The younger children enjoyed a lot and were able to brush up on their knowledge before FP classes actually started. The 11th std children also had a great time being a part of this project! And FP loved interacting with the children and providing a support for them!
