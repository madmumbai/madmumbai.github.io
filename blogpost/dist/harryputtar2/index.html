    <p>To engage FP volunteers ðŸ¥³, we organised calls for both the shelters, whose purpose was to break the ice and create bonding between the volunteers of the same vertical and shelter home. 

      We discussed FP components on the call, shared our personal stories ðŸ™Š that we had with the kids, helped the volunteersðŸ¥³ become more connected to the cause and interacted with one another.
      
      Before the main call, an entire week was planned to create hype on the Whatsapp group. From MAD bingo to meme the picture and much more, the volunteers were all hyped up before the call! Both the calls were a super hit!
