    <p>To engage FP volunteers ðŸ¥³, FP had organised calls for both the shelters, whose purpose was to break the ice and create bonding between the volunteers of the same vertical and shelter home. 

      FP discussed components on the call, shared their personal stories ðŸ™Š that FP volunteers and mentors had with the kids, this helped the volunteersðŸ¥³ become more connected to the cause and interacted with one another.
      
      Before the main call, an entire week was planned to create hype on the Whatsapp group. From MAD bingo to meme the picture and much more, the volunteers were all hyped up before the call! Both the calls were a super hit!
